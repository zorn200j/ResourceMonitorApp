# ResourceMonitorApp

- Name: Joshua Zorn  
- Student ID: 200364409

- This project is a computer resource monitor application for Windows 10. The project makes use of the OS's existing performance counters and displays a select number of them to the user in real time. It contains two elements: a console app and a browser app. 
The console app is run on the computer that the user wishes to monitor the resources of. The browser app is run on any computer that is on 
the same network as the computer being monitored (including the computer being monitored). This project is an expansion of another project I found intriguing: https://github.com/stevehobbsdev/blog-wcfcpuapp 

- To run the project, the browser app and console app can be debugged simultaneously within Visual Studio. First start the ResourceViewer, then start the ResourceConsole. This process is demonstrated with a video I created: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lJItuLDm130LJekxOHw0oE6CX7vQ8VpN
