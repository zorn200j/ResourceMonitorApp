- This project is a computer resource monitor application. The project makes use of the OS's existing performance counters and 
displays a select number of them to the user in real time. It contains two elements: a console app and a browser app. 
The console app is run on the computer that the user wishes to monitor. The browser app is run on any computer that is on 
the same network as the computer being monitored (including the computer being monitored).
